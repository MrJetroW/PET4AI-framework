## 🧩 Overview

The PET4AI Framework is a decision support prototype developed using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). It helps (Chief) Information Security Officers ((C)ISOs) and Data Protection Officers (DPOs) evaluate the need for PETs, identify suitable PET combinations, and understand implementation trade-offs when adopting AI technologies.
